Static frontend with localStorage (offline) DB for quick testing.

## Quick start
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Run a static server in the folder (e.g. `python -m http.server 5500`).
3. Open `http://localhost:5500/`
4. Sign in with seed users:
   - Company: `demo@brand.local` / `demo123`
   - Promoter: `promoter@demo.local` / `demo123`

## Notes
- Promoters see their **assigned stores** on Dashboard and can **check in/out** with **geofence**.
- Classic mobile burger menu included on every page.
- Stubs for Promoters/Stores/Post Campaign/Active/Super are provided so there are **no missing files**.
